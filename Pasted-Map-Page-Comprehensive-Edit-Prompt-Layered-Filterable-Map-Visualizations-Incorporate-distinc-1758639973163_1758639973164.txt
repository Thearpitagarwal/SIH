Map Page: Comprehensive Edit Prompt

Layered, Filterable Map Visualizations

Incorporate distinct map layers for:

Individual Forest Rights (IFR) claims and granted pattas

Community Rights (CR) and Community Forest Resource (CFR) boundaries

Village boundaries, forest compartments, and key assets (ponds, agriculture, water bodies, etc.)

Add interactive filters so users can view data by state, district, block, village, or tribal group.

Enable overlay toggles for asset layers (such as water bodies, farmland) in addition to claim data for comprehensive spatial context.

Dynamic Visual Status Updates

Design the map so that every claim or patta displayed has a clear visual status (pending, accepted, rejected):

Use color-coded pins or polygons (e.g., green for accepted, yellow for pending, red for rejected).

Ensure that whenever a claim decision (accept/reject) is made in the app, the corresponding element on the map updates immediately—without needing a page reload.

Provide a simple legend to explain color codes and statuses.

Intuitive Action Feedback

After any user action (accept/reject claim, toggle a layer, zoom to village), give instant, visible feedback:

Display a confirmation modal or toast notice for claim review decisions.

Consider animating the affected claim feature or briefly highlighting it.

If a claim is acted on, attach a visible tag or badge (e.g., “Accepted on: [date]”) in the info popup or sidebar.

User-Friendly Popups and Info Panels

Clicking a map feature (claim, asset, or boundary) should open a popup or side panel with:

All available details: claimant name, claim area, coordinates, village, asset type, date filed/status.

Supporting document preview links if present (e.g., scanned form, patta certificate).

Buttons for further actions or navigation (e.g., “Review in DSS,” “Download map,” “See related schemes”).

Source and Data Transparency

At the bottom of the map or as part of the map legend/help menu, clearly mention the origin of each dataset/layer (FSI, Census, India Geospatial, project upload, etc.).

Provide a disclaimer if any layer is sample/demo data in the prototype.

Accessible Navigation and Legend

Make sure users can always easily switch map views and turn on/off layers with minimal clicks.

Map legend should be ever-present or one-click accessible, clearly explaining all symbols and colors.

General Usability and Clarity

All design elements (popups, color schemes, legends, icons) should be readable and accessible, including on mobile.

Maintain consistent UI language (e.g., terminology for “claim,” “patta,” “asset”).

Include help/info tooltips where needed for non-expert users.
